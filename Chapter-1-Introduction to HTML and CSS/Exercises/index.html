    <!-- Ordered list of steps in the recipe method -->
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the flour mixture and beat on medium speed for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be very thin, but that's okay.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared baking pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
